## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in WebSeed, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do** open a public GitHub issue
2. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Considerations

WebSeed is a client-side application that processes images locally in the browser:

- **No server-side processing**: All image manipulation happens in your browser
- **No data transmission**: Images never leave your device
- **Local storage only**: No images are stored on external servers
- **File API usage**: Standard browser APIs for file handling

## Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.

Thank you for helping keep WebSeed secure!
